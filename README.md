# Swell Dwell

Swell Dwell is a JavaScript program that integrates Google Maps and the Storm Glass weather data API. The program allows you to explore weather data for any location on the map, or your current location. The weather data is displayed in a table format, with information such as water temperature, wind speed, wave height, and swell period.

## Getting Started
To use Weather Map, you will need to obtain an API key for the Storm Glass weather data API. You can sign up for a free account at Storm Glass, and get an API key that allows you to make a limited number of requests per day.

Once you have your API key, you can replace the STORM_GLASS_API_KEY constant in the code with your own key. You will also need to include the Google Maps API in your HTML file, by adding a `<script>` tag with your API key.

## Usage
To use the program, simply open the index.html file in your browser. You will be prompted to allow the program to access your location. Once you have done so, the map will load and display your current location. You can click on any location on the map to see the weather data for that location.
