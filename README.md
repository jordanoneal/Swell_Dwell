# Swell Dwell

Swell Dwell is a JavaScript program that integrates Google Maps and the Storm Glass weather data API. The program allows you to explore weather data for any location on the map, or your current location. The weather data is displayed in a table format, with information such as water temperature, wind speed, wave height, and swell period.

## Usage

To use the program, simply open the index.html file in your browser. Once you have done so, you can click on any location on the map to see the weather data for that location.
